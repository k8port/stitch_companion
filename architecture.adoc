= SPEC-001: Cross Stitch Pattern Generator Application
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

This application enables users to generate cross stitch patterns from images provided via direct upload or via a shared link. The application backend processes the image to create a simplified cross-stitch or embroidery pattern using a variety of image analysis techniques. The application front-end allows users to preview and adjust patterns, while backend processes adjust the image according to user-specified parameters like color count, image type, and other customizations.

== Requirements

=== Must Haves:
1. Web-based front-end built with React that allows users to:
  * Upload images or provide an image link
  * Specify image type as "painting", "illustration", or "icon", where image types are described as:
    * "Painting": Generates patterns using the entire image, where users specify how many unique colors (threads) should be included in the resulting pattern.
    * "Icon": Generates single-color patterns, ideal for distinct shapes or lettering.
    * "Illustration": Focuses on foreground subjects and uses background removal and dynamic cropping strategies to isolate the focal point.
  * Adjust pattern parameters, such as:
    * Color count (for "painting")
    * Thread brand for color matching (e.g., DMC, Anchor)
  * Preview generated cross stitch patterns in real-time.
  * Download patterns in a usable format (PDF, SVG, or PNG).

2. Backend API (using Flask or FastAPI) that handles:
  * Image uploads and processing.
  * Cross stitch pattern generation, based on image type and selected parameters.
  * Return of generated patterns to front-end for rendering and downloading.

3. Pattern generation strategies based on image type:
  * "Painting": Applies KMeans clustering to limit colors.
  * "Icon": Generates single-color patterns.
  * "Illustration": Applies content-aware cropping and employs various background removal strategies, including:
    * Edge Detection for Bounding Box: Identify subject boundaries and crop.
    * Golden Ratio Cropping: Crop based on the aesthetically pleasing area around the focal point.
    * Aspect Ratio Preservation: Uses padding as necessary to preserve aspect ratio.
    * Background Subtraction: Uses color analysis to detect and remove backgrounds.

=== Should Haves:
1. User authentication for saving and managing generated patterns.
2. Real-time pattern updates according to adjusted parameters.
3. Fine-tuning options to adjust the pattern after initial generation (e.g., minor edits to color areas, thread selection).

=== Could Haves:
1. Machine learning-based saliency detection or object detection for automatic cropping and focal point detection in "illustration" mode.
2. Collaborative features for multiple users to work on patterns in future iterations.

=== Won't Have (for now):
* Multi-user collaboration on patterns.

== Method

The technical solution consists of three key components:

1. Front-End (React)
2. Backend API (Flask/FastAPI)
3. Pattern Generation Logic

Below is a detailed breakdown of each component.

=== Front-End (React)

The front-end serves as the user interface (UI) and allows users to upload images, select options, preview results, and download final patterns. React is used to build the UI and communicate with the backend API.

==== Key Features:

**Image Upload & Link Input** 
- Form component prompting users to upload images or input an image URL.
- Parameter Selectors represented by dropdowns and sliders for users to adjust settings, including:
  * Type of Image (Dropdown: "Painting", "Illustration", "Icon")
  * Color Count (Slider for "Painting")
  * Thread brand (Dropdown for color selection in "Painting" and "Illustration")
  * Preview: Display the generated pattern in real-time based on user input.
  * Download option to download the final pattern in SVG, PNG, or PDF format.

==== Component Breakdown:
* _ImageUploader_: Manages image upload or link input.
* _ParameterForm_: Allows users to configure parameters for pattern generation.
* _PatternPreview_: Displays the generated pattern.
* _DownloadButton_: Enables users to download the pattern in the selected format.

==== API Communication:

React will communicate with the backend API using axios or fetch. The backend will return the generated pattern in a usable format (e.g., an SVG or PNG), which will be rendered in the PatternPreview component.

=== Backend API (Flask/FastAPI)

The backend will be responsible for image processing, pattern generation, and returning the results to the front-end. Flask or FastAPI will be used to expose RESTful API endpoints for communication with the front-end.

==== API Endpoints:
* POST `/upload`: Accepts an image upload or URL, along with parameters such as type of image, color count, and thread brand.
* GET `/preview`: Generates a cross stitch pattern based on the provided parameters and returns a preview image (SVG or PNG).
* GET `/download`: Allows users to download the final cross stitch pattern in a specified format (PDF, SVG, or PNG).

==== Backend Workflow:
1. Image Upload/URL Fetch: The backend will either accept an uploaded image or fetch an image from a provided URL.
2. Image Type Selection:
   * "Painting": Use KMeans clustering to limit the color palette to the user-specified number of unique colors.
   * "Icon": Convert the image to a single-color pattern using edge detection to capture distinct shapes and letters.
   * "Illustration": Use content-aware cropping, background subtraction, and dynamic cropping techniques to isolate the subject.
3. Pattern Generation: The backend will process the image according to the userâ€™s choices and generate a cross stitch pattern, returning the result as a preview.
4. Final Pattern Download: Users can request the final pattern in a chosen format (PDF, SVG, or PNG).

==== Pattern Generation Algorithms:
* KMeans Clustering (for "Painting") will reduce the image's colors based on the user's specified number of threads.
* Single-Color Pattern (for "Icon") will convert the image to a monochromatic format, using edge detection to outline distinct shapes.
* Illustration Handling:
   * Content-Aware Cropping will remove unnecessary background space using methods like Edge Detection for Bounding Box or Golden Ratio Cropping.
   * Background Subtraction will detect and remove uniform backgrounds using color similarity and adaptive thresholding techniques.
   * Aspect Ratio Preservation will ensure the resulting pattern fits a standard frame or aspect ratio, padding the image if necessary.

=== Pattern Generation Logic

The logic for generating patterns will differ based on the image type:

* For "Painting":
   * Apply KMeans clustering to reduce the number of colors.
   * Generate a pattern with user-specified thread brands for matching colors.
* For "Icon":
   * Convert the image to a single-color pattern using edge detection techniques like the Canny Edge Detector.
* For "Illustration":
   * Content-Aware Cropping: Use edge detection or saliency detection to isolate the focal point and crop out unnecessary background areas.
   * Background Subtraction: Identify regions of uniform color (e.g., adaptive thresholding) and remove them from the pattern.
   * Dynamic Cropping: Automatically crop the image based on its content using machine learning techniques like saliency detection.
   * Aspect Ratio Preservation: Add padding if necessary to preserve aspect ratio.
